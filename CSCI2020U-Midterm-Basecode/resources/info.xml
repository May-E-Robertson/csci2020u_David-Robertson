        <![CDATA[This software has two different functions as outlined below. Please select the desired function from the main menu


        Animation:
        This function animates a duck based on the sprite sheet provided from the assignment.
        It animates at one frame every four seconds, including taking four seconds to initially appear.
        The tan duck was chosen based off my student number as outlined in the assignment pdf.

        2D Graphics:
        This function prints my initials, D.R., using javafx shapes. The shapes used are rectangles, arc strokes, and arcs.
        There is a label at the top of the screen that reads "D.R." for reference, in case you can't read my shapes.


        Every screen has a button labelled "Back to Main" that allows you to return to the main menu.


        Please enjoy the program :^)]]>
